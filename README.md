# Hello! Let me introduce myself.

I'm Danche Choi, and I am a student who happens to love tinkering with computers.
I live in London, and I love GNU/Linux.

## Distrohopping

So yeah, I was/am a distrohopper. Here are the distros I have used in chronological order:
* Ubuntu
* M$ Windows 8/10 (Let's say that I didn't know how to install *nVidia* drivers on Ubuntu)
* Ubuntu (again)
* Kubuntu (I used to love KDE)
* KDE Neon (I realised that there were newer versions of KDE plasma available)
* OpenSUSE Tumbleweed
* Manjaro
* Arch (I had to reinstall < 6 times)
* Fedora Silverblue (I got in love with immutablity)
* Arch (I did not know it was possible to layer packages on `rpm-ostree` based systems)
* Parabola (This was when I hated "blobs")
* Guixâ€”with no desktop
* Debian Sid (Broke once or twice)
* Pop!\_OS: When I came to my senses and quit using rolling-release distros
* Ubuntu (Again, second time)
* Vanilla OS (Really, Really good)
* Blend OS (Less than 24 hours)
* Fedora Silverblue (Yes, again!)

My best tip for most users is to use an immutable OS.
If it breaks, just rollback!
For tinkerers, just do your stuff in a `toolbx` or `distrobox` container.

## Programming Languages
* Bash
* A bit of Python
* A bit of C
* Some Scratch.
